Mathematics makes our life orderly and prevents chaos. Certain qualities that are nurtured by mathematics are power of reasoning, creativity, abstract or spatial thinking, critical thinking, problem-solving ability and even effective communication skills.Mathematics is the cradle of all creations, without which the world cannot move an inch. Be it a cook or a farmer, a carpenter or a mechanic, a shopkeeper or a doctor, an engineer or a scientist, a musician or a magician, everyone needs mathematics in their day-to-day life. Even insects use mathematics in their everyday life for existence.

<p><i>2. Let the first discount be x% <br>Then, 87.5% of (100-x)% of 150 = 105 <br>87.5/100 * (100-x)/100 * 150 = 105<br> -> (100-x) = 105 * 100 * 100/150 * 87.5 = 80 </i></p>
<p><i>3. Let the distance be x km. then,<br>(time taken to walk x km) + (time taken to ride x km) = 37 min <br> (time taken to walk 2x km) + (time taken to ride 2x km) = 74min<br>But,time taken to walk 2x km = 55 min<br>Time taken to ride 2x km = (74 - 55)min = 19 min</i></p>
<p><i>4. Value of the machine after 2 years<br>= Rs.[162000*(1-10/100)<sup>2</sup> = Rs.(162000*9/10*9/10) = Rs.131220.<br>Value of the machine two years ago<br> = Rs.[162000/(1-10/100)<sup>2</sup>] = Rs.(162000*10/9*10/9) = Rs.200000</i></p>
<p><i>5. Let C's capital = Rs.x Then, B's capital be 2/3x<br>A's capital = Rs. (3 * 2/3x) = Rs. 2x.<br>Ratio of their capitals = 2x:2/3x:x = 6:2:3<br>Hence,B's share = Rs.(6600*2/11) = 1200</i></p>
<p><i>6. (A's 1 day's work) : (B's 1 day's work) = 2:1<br>(A + B)'s 1 day's work = 1/18<br>A's 1 day's work = (1/18 * 2/3) = 1/27<br> Hence A alone can finish the work in 27 days.</i></p>
<p><i>7. Speed of the train relative to man = (68 - 8)kmph = (60 * 5/18)m/sec = (50/3)m/sec<br>Time taken by thetrain to cross the man<br> = Time taken by it to cover 150m at (50/3)m/sec = (150 * 3/50)sec = 9 sec.</i></p>
<p><i>P = 68,000   R = 2/3%   T = 9/12 years = 3/4 years<br>S.I. = Rs.(68,000 * 2/3 * 3/4 * 1/100) = 340</i></p>
